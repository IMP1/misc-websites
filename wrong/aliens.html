                    Graham Hancock who is an idol of mine - is not a fan of the Ancient Alien hypothesis, 
                    he prefers to believe their was once a very advanced human civilization who built the pyramids in Egypt, Mexico and China that was destroyed in a cataclysm. 
                    I'm not going to speculate because I don't know if they were aliens or not, 
                    but it would be nice to know, but anyway that's in the past...people need to focus on the now.
