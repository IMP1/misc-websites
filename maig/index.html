			<h2>Reactive Agents</h2>
			<p>
			Use simple behaviour to "simulate" intellegence <br>
			e.g. run away from predator and run towards friends
			</p>

			<p>
			Rules are a set of actions that decide the behaviour of the agent <br>
			Several rules can fire simultaneously (e.g. avoid from wall while moving towards target) <br>
			Rules are defined defined as (c, a)
			<ul>
				<li><strong>c</strong>: condition for the rule to fire</li>
				<li><strong>a</strong>: the action taken when c becomes true</li>
			</ul>
			Rule will fire when the environment is in state s ∈ S and c ⊆ see(s) (The agent sees state that triggers condition) <br>
			Rules can have a priority ordering (e.g. b1 ≺ b2 means b1 <i>inhibits</i> b2 (in other words b1 will have priority over b2))
			</p>

			<p>
			Reactive agents are simple and fast <br>
			If the rules are well designed an agent will have near optimal performance (see Mars rover example)<br>
			Can be hard to design rules for complex environments
			</p>

			<h4>Mars rover example</h4>
			<strong>Scenario</strong>: A spaceship lands on Mars. It is known that there are valuable resources on the planet, but their locations are unknown. The resources normally occur in clusters. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tactic</strong>: Deploy many robots that follow a simple set of rules to find the resources and return them to the spaceship. Use a radio transmitter on the spaceship that will allow robots to <i>home</i> back to the spaceship by moving towards the source of the radio signal. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Rules</strong> (in priority ordering):
			<ol>
				<li>If detect and obstacle then change direction</li>
				<li>If carrying sample and at storage unit then drop sample</li>
				<li>If carrying sample then travel torwards spaceship</li>
				<li>If detect sample then pick it up</li>
				<li>Move randomly</li>
			</ol>
			<strong>Rules for agent coordination</strong> (used so that the other robots help each other):
			<ol>
				<li value="3">If carrying samples drop 2 crumbs while travelling back to spaceship</li>
				<li value="5">If detect crumb then pick up 1 crumb and travel away from the spaceship following the trail of crumbs</li>
			</ol>
